    <p>A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. Finding them is part of the database design . The sequence of reasoning when constructing a diagram of functional dependencies is as follows. The normalization with dependency diagram proved to be the most efficient method, and was also confirmed by the statistical estimation of the carried out .
